# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post on my new portfolio website. I'm excited to share my journey and thoughts here.

## What to Expect

- Web development tips
- Project showcases
- Career experiences
- Technology insights

Here's some code I've been working with recently:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to my blog.`;
}

console.log(greet('Reader'));
